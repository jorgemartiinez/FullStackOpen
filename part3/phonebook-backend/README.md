# Backend for phonebooks, part 3

[Heroku project link](https://backend-part3.herokuapp.com/)

All the routes have a /api endpoint.

I had to make my own project structure in order to make it easier for me to manage. All the files related to the server are inside server folder, I've also separated the models, routes and middlewares into their own directory
